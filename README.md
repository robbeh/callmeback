callmeback
==========

A while ago, a client asked me to create a simply contact form that asked the site user to submit just a name and number 
so that the client could give them a call.

I decided to add a few features, package it up to upload it to codecanyon. Without a clear explanation as to why they rejected
it I have chosen to open source it.
